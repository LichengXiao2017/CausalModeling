# Introduction

This is a Java program using causal modeling in cyber security context to generate policy of whether to allow the user to continue access to articles, and whether to notify homeland security, based on four boolean parameters abstracted from immediate user data.

# How to run the model

./model/test.java can be tested in IDE such as Eclipse. You may modify the four parameters as you wish, and check the print information on the console.

The logic of the main program was explained in ./model/model.java, with comments before each coding block.
